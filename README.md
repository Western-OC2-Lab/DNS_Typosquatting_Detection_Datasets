# DNS_Typosquatting_Detection_Datasets
**Description:**

This repository contains the datasets used as part of the OC2 lab's work on DNS Typosquatting Detection using machine learning methods.

The repository contains 2 folders:
- "Datasets" folder: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in this project.
- "Codes" folder: contains the Matlab codes used to process the raw datasets and generate the processed datasets.
